For example, you write a Python code block that computes some HTML, and this HTML is injected in place of the code block. Requirements \u00a4 Markdown Exec requires Python 3.7 or above. To install Python 3.7, I recommend using pyenv . # install pyenv git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv ~/.pyenv # setup pyenv (you should also put these three lines in .bashrc or similar) export PATH = \" ${ HOME } /.pyenv/bin: ${ PATH } \" export PYENV_ROOT = \" ${ HOME } /.pyenv\" eval \" $( pyenv init - ) \" # install Python 3.7 pyenv install 3 .7.12 # make it available globally pyenv global system 3 .7.12 Installation \u00a4 With pip : pip install markdown-exec Configuration \u00a4 This extension relies on the SuperFences extension of PyMdown Extensions . To allow execution of code blocks, configure a custom fence from Python: from markdown import Markdown from markdown_exec import formatter , validator Markdown ( extensions = [ \"pymdownx.superfences\" ], extension_configs = { \"pymdownx.superfences\" : { \"custom_fences\" : [ { \"name\" : \"python\" , \"class\" : \"python\" , \"validator\" : validator , \"format\" : formatter , } ] } } ) ...or in MkDocs configuration file: markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.superfences : custom_fences : - name : python class : python validator : !!python/name:markdown_exec.validator format : !!python/name:markdown_exec.formatter Usage \u00a4 You are now able to execute code blocks instead of displaying them: ```python exec=\"on\" print(\"Some Python code\") ``` The exec option will be true for every possible value except 0 , no , off and false (case insensitive). The standard output and error of executed Python code blocks is not captured and will be written to the terminal, as usual. If you want to \"inject\" contents into the page, you can use these two functions in your code blocks (they are available in the global context of execution): output_html(text) : inject the HTML text passed as argument. output_markdown(text) : convert the text passed as argument to HTML and then inject it. Warning You can call these functions only once, as they internally raise an exception.

Development \u00a4 As usual: create a new branch: git checkout -b feature-or-bugfix-name edit the code and/or the documentation Before committing: run make format to auto-format the code run make check to check everything (fix any warning) run make test to run the tests (fix any issue) if you updated the documentation or the project dependencies: run make docs-serve go to http://localhost:8000 and check that everything looks good follow our commit message convention If you are unsure about how to fix or ignore a warning, just let the continuous integration fail, and we will help you during review.
